# OGJ2020
Open Game Jam Resources for Open Game Jame 2020


This will host the whole Unity Project and all available assets.

Clone the repository at your convenience, and (if you are on the initial project) feel free to let me know about 
folders you would want in order to organize your files if you are unable to create them yourself.

The intention here is to involve those on my team who would prefer a cloning system that is more than the Unity 
built-in "collab button", and for those times when a file is created on a tablet or on another source which doesn't
have easy access to the Unity "collab button" but DOES have a Github application 
(like Android and iOS tablets, mobile phones)


Thanks for all the content you are helping me make public and open source!
